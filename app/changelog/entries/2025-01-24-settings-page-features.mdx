## Overview

We've enhanced the settings page with a new Features Overview section that provides a clear, visual representation of all your subscription features and usage limits.

## What's New

### ðŸ“Š Features Overview Section
A new dedicated section that displays all your plan features in an easy-to-scan card layout:

- **Domains** - Displays current usage vs. limit with progress bar
- **Email Retention** - Shows retention period (days or unlimited)
- **Emails Received** - Tracks inbound email usage with visual progress
- **Emails Sent** - Monitors outbound email usage with progress indicator

### ðŸŽ¨ Design Improvements

- **Card-based layout**: Each feature gets its own card with generous spacing
- **Responsive grid**: Adapts from 2 columns on tablets to 4 columns on desktop
- **Visual indicators**: Color-coded icons and progress bars for quick scanning
- **Dark mode support**: Seamless integration with the app's theme system

### ðŸ’¡ User Experience

- **At-a-glance monitoring**: See all your feature usage in one place
- **Progress visualization**: Instantly understand your usage vs. limits
- **Clean hierarchy**: Important numbers are prominently displayed
- **Consistent styling**: Matches the app's modern design language

## Technical Details

The features are pulled directly from your Autumn subscription data:
```typescript
const domainsFeature = customerData?.features?.['domains']
const emailRetentionFeature = customerData?.features?.['email_retention']
const inboundTriggersFeature = customerData?.features?.['inbound_triggers']
const emailsSentFeature = customerData?.features?.['emails_sent']
```

Each feature card includes:
- Feature name and icon
- Current usage (where applicable)
- Maximum limit or unlimited indicator
- Visual progress bar for usage-based features

## Impact

This update provides better visibility into your subscription features without requiring navigation to external billing portals. All existing functionality remains unchanged - this is purely an additive improvement to help you better understand and monitor your plan limits.
